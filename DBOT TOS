Title: Discord Bot Terms of Service

Acceptance of Terms
By using the DBot Discord bot (the "Bot"), you signify your agreement to these terms of service (the "Terms of Service") and acknowledge that you have read and understood them. If you do not agree with these Terms of Service, you should not use the Bot.

Description of Services
The Bot provides automated features, functions, and services designed to enhance interaction and management on Discord servers. The specific capabilities of the Bot may vary depending on the configuration and permissions set by the server administrator.

Account Registration and Security
To use some advanced features of the Bot, you may need to register for an account. During registration, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.

Prohibited Conduct
When using the Bot, you agree not to:

a. Engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Bot or the servers it connects to.
b. Share, distribute, or make available any viruses, worms, Trojan horses, or other items of a destructive nature.
c. Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Bot, other accounts, computer systems, or networks connected to the Bot, through hacking, password mining, or any other means.
d. Harass, threaten, bully, intimidate, or cause distress or inconvenience to any other person.
e. Post, upload, transmit, or otherwise disseminate any content that is illegal, offensive, obscene, threatening, defamatory, libelous, invasive of anotherâ€™s privacy, infringing upon intellectual property rights, or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable.
f. Use the Bot in violation of applicable laws or regulations.
g. Facilitate or encourage any violations of these Terms of Service.
h. Impersonate any person or entity, including but not limited to, a Discord employee, representative, or another user.
i. Solicit login credentials or personally identifiable information from other users.
j. Advertise or solicit any goods or services unless explicitly authorized by the Bot owner.
k. Violate the intellectual property rights of others, including copyrights, trademarks, patents, or trade secrets.
l. Encourage or promote any activity that violates these Terms of Service.
m. Use the Bot in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Bot or the servers it connects to.
n. Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, decipher, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code of the Bot.
o. Use the Bot for commercial purposes without explicit permission from the Bot owner.
p. Use the Bot in any way that is not expressly permitted by these Terms of Service.

Termination
We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the Bot at any time, without prior notice, for any reason, including but not limited to, breaches or violations of these Terms of Service. Upon termination, your right to use the Bot will immediately cease, and you must promptly destroy all materials obtained from the Bot.

Limitation of Liability
In no event shall DBot be liable for any damages arising out of or relating to your use or inability to use the Bot, including but not limited to, direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, even if DBot has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold DBot, its affiliates, officers, agents, employees, and partners harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of your use of the Bot, your violation of these Terms of Service, or your violation of any rights of another.

Governing Law
These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law. Any action arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service shall be filed only in the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts in any such action.

Entire Agreement
These Terms of Service represent the entire agreement between you and DBot concerning the use of the Bot and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, whether oral or written. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
