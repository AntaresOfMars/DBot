Title: Discord Bot Privacy Policy

Introduction
This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how we, [YourBotName], collect, use, and disclose information in connection with the operation of our Discord bot (the "Bot"). By using or interacting with the Bot, you consent to the collection, processing, and sharing of your personal data in accordance with this Policy. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use the Bot.

Information We Collect
We may collect the following types of information when you use or interact with the Bot:

a. Personal Data: This includes any information that can be used to identify an individual, such as name, email address, or Discord ID. We only collect this information if it is provided voluntarily by users who have granted the bot administrative permissions on their servers.
b. Usage Data: This refers to data related to your interactions with the Bot, including commands issued, messages sent, and server metadata.
c. Server Metadata: This includes data about the Discord servers where the Bot operates, such as server name, icon, description, and member count.
d. IP Addresses: We may also collect IP addresses from users connecting to the Bot for security purposes and to ensure proper functioning of the service.

Use of Collected Information
We may use the collected information for various purposes, including:
a. Providing and improving the functionality of the Bot;
b. Responding to user queries and requests;
c. Enforcing the terms of use of the Bot;
d. Protecting against fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; and
e. Complying with applicable laws and regulations.

Sharing of Collected Information
We will not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal data to third parties without your consent, except as follows:
a. Service Providers: We may engage third-party companies or individuals to perform services on our behalf, such as hosting providers, maintenance or analysis services. These third parties may have access to your personal data but only for the purpose of performing these tasks on our behalf.
b. Legal Requirements: We may share your personal data if required to do so by law or pursuant to legal process, or in response to a request from law enforcement or other government agencies. In such cases, we will take reasonable measures to protect your personal data to the extent required by law.
c. Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if either all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, or in the event that we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

Security Measures
We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to secure your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Retention Period
We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to provide you with the services offered through the Bot, or until you ask us to delete it. Keep in mind that deletion by us does not extend to copies made by users. When deciding what retention period is appropriate, we consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process your personal data, and applicable legal requirements.

User Access and Control
You have certain rights regarding your personal data, subject to local data protection laws. These include the right to review, update, correct or delete your personal data in our records. To exercise these rights, contact us at [email protected]. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

Children's Privacy
Our Bot is intended for general audiences, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under the age of 13, we will take steps to remove such information from our files as soon as possible.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Policy, we will notify you via a notice on our website or by sending you an email notification, prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to regularly check back and review any updates. Your continued use of the Bot after any modification to the Policy constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
